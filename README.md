# Exploratory Data Project

This repo has R scripts with four functions Plot1.R, Plot2.R, Plot3.R and Plot4.R for four plots as described in course project description page. 
The scripts use data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/). 

The plots generated by the scripts are Plot1.PNG, Plot2.PNG, Plot3.PNG and Plot4.PNG. The files can be found in the same repo.

## Instructions:
If you attempt to run this code make sure to keep Electronic Power Consumption data (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip) 
in the same folder as the scripts. Also, please be cautions as the file contains about 2.03 million records so depending upon
computing power of your machine it may take long time to load. Lastly, you will need to set the working directory to be same
as the R scripts directory.
